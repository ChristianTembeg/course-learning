       Project Description
This project will be a Course Platform built with Django, a popular web framework.
It will allow teachers to upload their lessons online and let students watch those lessons from anywhere.
Each course will contain several lessons, videos, and notes. The videos and images will be stored in the cloud using Cloudinary, so users won’t need to download heavy files to their computers.
The main goal of this platform will be to make learning easy and accessible for students, especially in Africa, where not everyone has strong internet or expensive computers.
The app will have a simple interface made with TailwindCSS, which means it will look clean and work well on both phones and laptops.

How the App Will Work
•	Teachers will be able to create accounts and upload their courses.
•	Students will register, browse available courses, and start learning.
•	Each lesson will have a short video, some notes, and a thumbnail image.
•	The system will send email messages for confirmation or notifications.
•	All media files (videos, images) will be kept in the cloud, which will make the app light and fast.

Proof of Scalability
This app will be scalable because it will use cloud services.
When more people start using the platform, the system will not slow down.
Instead of keeping videos and images on one local computer, everything will be stored in Cloudinary, a large online storage platform.
Cloudinary will automatically adjust its capacity when more videos are uploaded, so there will be no need to buy new servers.
Also, Django is designed to handle many users. If traffic increases, more servers can be added easily without changing the code.
This means the platform will start small, maybe for one school, and later grow to support many schools or even universities.

Proof of Fault Tolerance
The app will be fault-tolerant, which means it will keep running even if some parts fail.
Because the videos and images will be stored in Cloudinary, they won’t get lost if something happens to the main server.
Cloudinary will keep backups of every file on multiple machines, so even if one machine fails, the videos will stay safe.
The database will also be backed up regularly, and if the app crashes or one part stops working, Django will restart it without losing information.
This will make the platform reliable and strong against small problems.

Proof of Collaboration
The platform will also support collaboration between teachers and students.
Each course page will allow students to leave comments or ask questions about lessons.
Teachers will be able to answer those comments directly from the site.
When new lessons or updates are posted, students will receive email notifications.
This will help them stay connected and interact easily with the instructor.
It will also be possible for multiple teachers to upload different courses on the same platform.
Students will be able to enroll in more than one course and learn from different teachers — that will create real collaboration inside a learning community.

Why It Will Fit the African Context
Many students in Africa face challenges like low internet speed and limited storage.
This project will help solve those problems because it will use cloud technology — lessons will be streamed online without needing to download them.
The interface will be simple, mobile-friendly, and light to load.
Teachers will also be able to create courses in local languages to make learning more inclusive.

Summary
In short, this Course Platform will be a simple but powerful web application built with Django.
It will be:
•	Scalable → it will grow as more users join, thanks to cloud storage and Django’s design.
•	Fault-tolerant → it will stay online even if one part fails, because files and data will be safely stored in the cloud.
•	Collaborative → it will connect teachers and students through comments, messages, and shared lessons.
